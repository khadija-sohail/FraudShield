## Overview

FraudShield simulates an analyst fraud operations center. It covers the full lifecycle of a suspicious financial transaction — from the moment it hits the system with a risk score, through alert creation and analyst assignment, all the way to case resolution and recovery tracking.

The project was built to understand how real fraud detection systems work in practice: how banks and fintechs triage risk, manage SLA-bound cases, track fraud losses vs. recoveries, and coordinate analyst teams — without relying on third-party fraud APIs.

---
Getting Started
> **The fastest way:** Use XAMPP (Windows/macOS/Linux). It gives you PHP + MySQL in one installer with zero configuration. The whole setup takes about 5 minutes.
---
## 🪟 Windows — Using XAMPP (Recommended)

1. **Download and install XAMPP** Go to [apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org) and download the Windows installer. Run it and install to the default path `C:\xampp`. During installation, make sure Apache and MySQL are checked.

2. **Start Apache and MySQL** Open the XAMPP Control Panel (search for it in your Start Menu) and click **Start** next to both Apache and MySQL. Both status lights should turn green.

3. **Put the project files in the right folder** Copy your project folder (containing `fraud_dashboard.html`, `db.php`, and `fraudshield_schema.sql`) into:  
   `C:\xampp\htdocs\fraudshield\`
   
Copy your project folder (containing `fraud_dashboard.html`, `db.php`, and `fraudshield_schema.sql`) into:
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\fraudshield\
```
If you're cloning from GitHub:
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fraudshield.git
```
Step 4 — Open the app in your browser
```
http://localhost/fraudshield/fraud_dashboard.html
```
macOS — Using XAMPP
1.  Download XAMPP for macOS
Go to https://www.apachefriends.org, download the macOS `.dmg` installer, and drag it to your Applications folder.
2. Start the servers
Open XAMPP from Applications, and in the manager window click Start All (or start Apache and MySQL individually from the Manage Servers tab).
3. Copy project files
```bash
# Open terminal and navigate to XAMPP's web root
cd /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs

# Clone or copy your project here
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fraudshield.git
```
Step 4 — Open in browser
```
http://localhost/fraudshield/fraud_dashboard.html
```
> **macOS tip:** If Apache won't start because port 80 is in use, open XAMPP → Manage Servers → Apache → Configure and change the port to `8080`. Then use `http://localhost:8080/fraudshield/fraud_dashboard.html`.
---
🐧 Linux — Using XAMPP or Native Stack
Option A — XAMPP on Linux
```bash
# Download XAMPP installer from apachefriends.org, then:
chmod +x xampp-linux-x64-*.run
sudo ./xampp-linux-x64-*.run

# Start XAMPP
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

# Copy project files
sudo cp -r /path/to/fraudshield /opt/lampp/htdocs/
```
Open: `http://localhost/fraudshield/fraud_dashboard.html`
Option B — Native LAMP stack (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install Apache, PHP, MySQL, and required PHP extensions
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php php-mysql mysql-server libapache2-mod-php -y

# Start services
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl start mysql

# Secure MySQL and set a root password (optional but recommended)
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Copy project to web root
sudo cp -r /path/to/fraudshield /var/www/html/fraudshield

# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/fraudshield
``
`
Open: `http://localhost/fraudshield/fraud_dashboard.html`

---
⚙️ DB Credentials (All Platforms)
Open `db.php` in any text editor and check lines 7–9. By default they match a fresh XAMPP install:
```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', '');        // XAMPP default is blank password
define('DB_NAME', 'fraudshield');
```
If your MySQL has a root password set, put it in `DB_PASS`. If you want to use a different database user, create one in phpMyAdmin first.

---
🗄️ phpMyAdmin (Optional — to view/inspect your database)
XAMPP includes phpMyAdmin for browsing your database visually:

```
http://localhost/phpmyadmin
```
Log in with `root` and your password (blank by default in XAMPP). You'll see the `fraudshield` database appear here after first page load.

---
| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `admin@fraudshield.io` | `admin123` |
| **Manager** | `manager@fraudshield.io` | `manager123` |
---
### How Fraud Scoring Works

FraudShield uses a rule-based risk score (0–99) to classify each transaction:

| Score Range | Risk Level | Transaction Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 85 – 99 | Critical | Blocked |
| 61 – 84 | High | Flagged |
| 31 – 60 | Medium | Under Review |
| 0 – 30 | Low | Cleared |

The score is currently assigned at insertion time (manually or via demo seed data). Future versions will compute it dynamically from behavioral signals — see the **Roadmap**.

---

### Fraud Rule Engine

The fraud rule engine (in the Admin panel) stores named rules with configurable thresholds, such as:

* **High-Value Transaction** — flag any single transaction above a set amount

* **Velocity Check** — multiple transactions in a short window

* **Geographic Anomaly** — transaction from an unusual location

* **Device Mismatch** — transaction from an unrecognized device fingerprint

---

*Visualizing the next generation of the FraudShield Executive Overview, featuring advanced analytics and real-time detection accuracy tracking.*
This is where the project gets really interesting as We continue studying fraud detection, machine learning, and financial crime. Planned additions:

#### 🤖 Machine Learning Integration
- [ ] **Real-time fraud scoring model** — Train an XGBoost or LightGBM classifier on the Kaggle IEEE-CIS dataset and expose it as a Python Flask microservice that `db.php` calls for each new transaction.  
  *Reference: XGBoost for Fraud Detection — Towards Data Science*
- [ ] **Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest** — Flag behavioral outliers (unusual time, location, or amount) without needing labeled fraud data.  
  *Reference: Isolation Forest Paper — Liu et al.*
- [ ] **Graph-based fraud detection** — Model customer-merchant-device relationships as a graph; fraud rings show unusual clustering patterns.  
  *Reference: Graph Neural Networks for Fraud — Amazon*
- [ ] **Velocity feature engineering** — Compute rolling windows (5-min, 1-hour, 24-hour) of transaction count and amount per customer/device/IP as model features.
- [ ] **Explainability layer (SHAP)** — Show analysts why a transaction was flagged, not just the score.  
  *Reference: SHAP for ML Explainability*

#### 🔍 Detection Techniques To Add
- [ ] **Device fingerprinting** — Track canvas fingerprint, browser plugins, screen resolution to identify device reuse across different customer IDs.  
  *Reference: FingerprintJS*

- [ ] **Model performance dashboard** — Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC for the ML model, tracked over time.
- [ ] **Regulatory reporting templates** — SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) generation in standard format.

#### 🔗 Integrations To Study
- [ ] **SWIFT gpi** — Understanding real interbank wire fraud and how SWIFT's global payment initiative monitors it.  
  *Reference: SWIFT gpi Documentation*
- [ ] **Open Banking / PSD2** — How Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements in Europe affect fraud patterns.  
  *Reference: EBA PSD2 Guidelines*
